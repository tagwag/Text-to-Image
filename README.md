# Text-to-Image
This program can take any text file (or any file really) and convert it to a .pbm file. 
This .pbm file can then be opened in a program like Adobe Photoshop and then be exported to a .png. 
It was created out of a desire to convert ASCII to color. 
This is to create art and also fun secret message that you can place within other images to talk with friends! 
This code is not perfect so feel free to email me tag.wagley@gmail.com to help me debug it! 
Feel free to donate money to my Venmo @tagwag to help me create more fun programs!
